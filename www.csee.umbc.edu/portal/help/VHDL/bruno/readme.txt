After much messing around with windows and finding all of my old project,
I have finally come up with the all inclusive collection of my masters
projects. things are still a bit jumbled, but with a little effort, you
can piece together the original documents. If you are a stickler for
perfection, you can email me or write and I can have a copy made up.
I can have copies made at a local printshop and get them to you at cost. I
am not releasing these papers to try to get money, just to make them
available to people interested. After reading the papers, you will probably
be glad that you didn't pay for them :->.

These papers were two projects I did for Tufts University in order to
graduate with my diploma. Stealing the diploma was right out (they had them
locked up), so I sweated it and wrote the papers. They were done with only
6 months knowledge of VHDL. There are a lot of things which I would do
differently, but I don't have the time. At the very least these are examples
of what NOT to do.

With all that out of the way, a few things:
1) these papers are being made available for use by private individuals
        wishing to learn more about VHDL, or just to see poor examples :).
2) They may not be reproduced for profit.
3) They are provided as is.
4) Anyone wishing to add to the collection may do so keeping the copyright
        notices intact
5) Anyone wishing to get a copy of the documents in a microsoft word 6.0
        format in order to add to the papers, please e-mail.
6) Book offers, money or anything else, please e-mail.

This package contains:
1) Readme file (your reading it)
2) ASM.CPP
        program to generate Basic computer VHDL testbenches from textfiles
        Compiled for the PC using BC++ 3.1, milage may vary.
3) *.VHD
        VHDL to go with all the examples, as well as testbenches
4) mast*.ps

5) proj*.ps

Enjoy!! Lokking back as I type in these quick notes, I see how simple and
sometimes stupid my old code looks. Please be gentle with any flames.
